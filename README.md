# EthicsForTech

Readings for a course in ethics for those in technology fields,
such as engineering, computer science, data science, biotechnology and
so on.

Norm Matloff, UC Davis

# Background

I'm a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California,
Davis.  Our department has its own in-house ethics course, required for
our Computer Science and Engineering majors (this program's
accreditation requires students to have some exposure to ethics), and
popular with our Computer Science majors.

**I teach the course with the aim of having students ponder issues that
may confront them in the future, as tech professionals, managers and even
entrepreneurs.**

I'm making this reading list available publicly in case other
instructors may fine it useful.
