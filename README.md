such as engineering, computer science, data science, biotechnology and
so on.

# Background

I'm a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California,
Davis.  Our department has its own in-house ethics course, required for
our Computer Science and Engineering majors (this program's
accreditation requires students to have some exposure to ethics), and
popular with our Computer Science majors.

I teach the course with the aim of having students ponder issues that
may confront them in the future, as tech professionals, managers and even
entrepreneurs.

I'm making this reading list available publicly in case other
instructors may fine it useful.
