# EthicsForTech

Readings for a course in ethics for those in technology fields,
such as engineering, computer science, data science, biotechnology and
so on.

Norm Matloff, UC Davis

# Background

I'm a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California,
Davis.  [Here is my bio.](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html)

Our department has its own in-house ethics course, required for
our Computer Science and Engineering majors (this program's
accreditation requires students to have some exposure to ethics), and
popular with our Computer Science majors.

**I teach the course with the aim of having students ponder issues that
may confront them in the future, as tech professionals, managers and even
entrepreneurs.**

I'm making this reading list available publicly in case other
instructors may find it useful.

# Readings

Arranged in several topical units.  A small number of items may require
access via the UCD library; if you are not a UCD affiliate, your own

## Data privacy

*Privacy is dead, and social media holds the smoking gun* -- Privacy is
dead, and social media holds the smoking gun

*Privacy with medical information is a fallacy. If everyone’s
information is out there, it’s part of the collective* -- Craig Venter,
pioneer mapper of the human genome, entrepreneur

*A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all.
They’ll never know what it means to have a private moment to
themselves, an unrecorded unanalyzed thought. And that’s a problem
because privacy matters. Privacy is what allows us to determine who we
are and who we want to be* -- Edward Snowden, NSA
whistleblower/fugitive

## Ethics and culture

*When in Rome, do as the Romans do* -- Saint Ambrose

*If anyone, no matter who, were given the opportunity of choosing from
amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought
best, he would inevitably—after careful considerations of their relative
merits—choose that of his own country. Everyone without exception
believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in,
to be the best* -- Herodotus, ancient Greek historian

*Show me a cultural relativist at 30,000 feet and I'll show you a
hypocrite ... If you are flying to an international congress of
anthropologists or literary critics, the reason you will probably get
there - the reason you don't plummet into a ploughed field - is that a
lot of Western scientifically trained engineers have got their sum
right* -- Richard Dawkins, *River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life*

## Artificial Intelligence

*The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of
the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an
ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological
evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded* -- 
Stephen Hawking, Nobel physicist

*We have seen AI providing conversation and comfort to the lonely; we
have also seen AI engaging in racial discrimination. Yet the biggest
harm that AI is likely to do to individuals in the short term is job
displacement, as the amount of work we can automate with AI is vastly
larger than before. As leaders, it is incumbent on all of us to make
sure we are building a world in which every individual has an
opportunity to thrive* -- Andrew Ng, AI entrepreneur, former Stanford CS
professor
